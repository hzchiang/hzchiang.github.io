I am a Master’s student in the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://coe.gatech.edu/schools/electrical-and-computer-engineering) at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) (Georgia Tech). Simultaneously, I am also pursuing a Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering at [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn/english/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xiangyu Kong](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56496085900) from the [Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education on Smart Power Grids](https://seea.tju.edu.cn/info/1105/1712.htm).

My research revolves around prediction and decision-making in cyber-physical energy systems. My current research interests lie broadly in demand response in smart grids, distributed energy resources management, decarbonization of cyber-physical energy systems, and decision-making under uncertainty.
